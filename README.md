# Heading Highlighter Chrome Extension

## Overview

This is a simple Chrome extension built with **Plasmo** that allows users to toggle background highlighting for all headings (`h1` - `h6`) on a webpage. The extension uses **Plasmo‚Äôs messaging service** to communicate between the popup and content scripts, ensuring dynamic updates when toggling the feature.

## Features

- Toggle switch in the popup to enable/disable highlighting.
- Applies a **blue background color** to all headings (`h1`-`h6`).
- Uses **Plasmo content scripts** to modify the DOM dynamically.
- No need for storage; instead, it uses **message passing** for real-time updates.

## Installation

### **1. Clone Repo**

In your work directory, run this command to clone the repo and go into the local repo folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maxitect/heading-highlighter.git
cd heading-highlighter
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **pnpm** installed. Then, install Plasmo dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### **3. Run in Development Mode**

You can run the extension in **development mode** to test it live:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Then, open Chrome and go to:

```
chrome://extensions/
```

- Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
- Click **Load Unpacked** and select the `chrome-mv3-dev` in your project's `build` folder.

## Building & Installing for Production

To create a production-ready version of the extension:

```sh
pnpm build
```

This will generate a `build` folder. To install it in Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Click **Load Unpacked**.
4. Select the `chrome-mv3-prod` in your project's `build` folder.

> [!WARNING]
> FOR LINUX USERS\
> When running `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` in a Linux environment you may come accross dumping errors or errors related to a package called `sharp`. You may see an error such as:
>
> ```sh
> ‚ÄâELIFECYCLE‚Äâ Command failed with exit code 139.
> ```
>
> These seem to be caused by the latest `plasmo` dependencies under its tailwind configuration. Although such an error may pop up, the project has built and you can load it into Chrome as described above.

## How It Works

### **Popup (`popup.tsx`)**

- Manages the toggle switch state (`isEnabled`).
- Sends a message to **all open tabs** using `chrome.scripting.executeScript()`.
- Uses `window.postMessage()` to send `TOGGLE_HIGHLIGHTS` to the content script.

### **Toggle Switch (`toggle.tsx`)**

- Implements a Tailwind-styled toggle switch component.
- Uses `peer` class-based styling for state management.

### **Content Script (`highlightHeadings.ts`)**

- Runs on all pages (`<all_urls>`).
- Listens for `TOGGLE_HIGHLIGHTS` messages.
- Dynamically updates heading background colors based on the toggle state.

## Improvements & Future Enhancements

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Highlight Colors**

Allow users to select a **custom highlight color** instead of defaulting to blue. This can be achieved by adding an input color picker in the popup and passing the selected color to the content script.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Per-Site Preferences**

Instead of applying highlighting to all tabs, store the user‚Äôs preference **per website** using `chrome.storage.sync`. This would allow users to keep highlighting on specific sites.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Keyboard Shortcut Support**

Add a **keyboard shortcut** (e.g., `Ctrl + Shift + H`) to toggle highlighting without opening the popup. This can be implemented using `chrome.commands`.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Improved UI & Feedback**

- Display a **notification or badge** when highlighting is enabled.
- Show a **preview of the highlight effect** inside the popup.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Refactoring & Code Optimization**

- Abstract message handling into a separate module.
- Use TypeScript interfaces for better type safety.
- Optimize the content script for better performance on large pages.
